chatbot using nltk python library CHATBOT FOR EXAMINANTION QUERY A chatbot (also known as a talkbot, chatterbot, Bot, IM bot, interactive agent, or Artificial Conversational Entity) is a computer program or an artificial intelligence which conducts a conversation via auditory or textual methods. Such programs are often designed to convincingly simulate how a human would behave as a conversational partner, thereby passing the Turing test. Chatbots are typically used in dialog systems for various practical purposes including customer service or information acquisition. Some chatterbots use sophisticated NLP systems, but many simpler systems scan for keywords within the input, then pull a reply with the most matching keywords, or the most similar wording pattern, from a database.
we will learn to create a simple chat assistant or chatbot using Python’s NLTK library. NLTK has a module, nltk.chat, which simplifies building these engines by providing a generic framework. Modules of code:- Chat: This is a class that has all the logic that is used by the chatbot. Reflections: This is a dictionary that contains a set of input values and its corresponding output values. It is an optional dictionary that you can use. You can also create your own dictionary in the same format as below and use it in your code.
reflections = { "i am" : "you are", "i was" : "you were", "i" : "you", "i'm" : "you are", "i'd" : "you would", "i've" : "you have", "i'll" : "you will", "my" : "your", "you are" : "I am", "you were" : "I was", "you've" : "I have", "you'll" : "I will", "your" : "my", "yours" : "mine", "you" : "me", "me" : "you" }
You can also create your own reflections dictionary in the same format as above and use it in your code.
and use it as :
chat=Chat(pairs,my_dummy_reflections)
Source Code :
pairs
The code is quite simple, still lets understand it :-
->> Once the function chatty() is invoked , a default message will be displayed :
def chatty(): print("Hi, I'm Chatty and I chat alot ;)\nPlease type lowercase English language to start a conversation. Type quit to leave ")
->> Next step is to trigger the conversation :
chat.converse()
->> we have just hardcoded the probable question and answers in the list pairs.: from nltk.chat.util import Chat,reflections
pairs=[ ['my name is (.)',['hi! %1']], ['(hi|holla|heya|hey|hello)',['hey there!how may i help you?']], ['(.)in(.)is fun',['%1 in %2 is indeed fun ']], ['(.) ete',['ete:-weightage is fifty percent; try to score enough.what else?']], ['(.) mte',['mte:-weightage is twenty percent;try easy.what else?']], ['(.) ca',['ca:-weightage is twenty five percent;try to score as best as possible.what else?']], ['(.) attendance',['atten.:-weightage is five percent;mandatory :- seventy five plus percent.what else?']], ['(.) exam schedule',[' you will know it via ums or lpu touch.anything else i can help with?']], ['ok',['yups, anything else?']], ['yes',['may i know?']], ['sure',['go on..']], ['(.) path',['sure! ums- login >home>ums navigation>examination>time table','for lpu touch:-lputoch>exams available']], ['(.) (do not|did not)',[' score well in rest of examinations and specially in ca,also manage proper attendance.']], ['(.) backlog',['factors:more than ten percent in mte,more than twenty percent in ete,more then fourty percent overall/subject,umc back']], ['(.) umc back',['in case you were found disrespecting laws/ rules & regulation of university you are bearer of umc that undefines your scholarship as well as if serious you maybe backed']], ['(.) come to know our result or marks',['you will recieve lpu touch notification regarding that.']], ['(.) too see my answer sheets',[' regarding scrutiny of sheets -respective authorities will inform you although its for written sheets not mcq based.']], ['no',['thank you,had a great conversation.have a good day ahead!']], ['(.*) thank you',['thank you,had a great conversation.have a good day ahead!']], ]
The nltk.chat chatbots work on the regex of keywords present in your question. So you can add any number of questions in a proper format so that your chatbot doesn’t get confused in determining the regex.
